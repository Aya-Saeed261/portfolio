      Hello! My name is Aya, and I'm a frontend enthusiast. I love exploring
      frontend-related topics and discovering how the web works in general.
      <br /> I graduated from the Faculty of Engineering, Electrical Department.
      Honestly, I never felt that electrical engineering was my calling. It
      wasn't until I stumbled upon a web development course that I fell in love
      with coding. I decided to become a frontend developer, and I'm so glad I
      made that decision!
